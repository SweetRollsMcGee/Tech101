The sudden surge of new sites allowing us to post pictures, and share precious moments, has revolutionized use of the internet.

<li> Facebook's combination of status updates, information sharing and instant messaging is changing the way we communicate, and that's trickling down into the business world. The rise of social enterprise collaboration platforms is a direct response to this popular social media platform.

Facebook is also disruptive because it's another platform through which sensitive corporate information can escape into the wild (even inadvertently, thanks to its complex privacy settings and the potential for social engineering attacks).

<img src = "Twitter.png" height=100px>
<li>This Twitter Research Forum essay by Ann Pegoraro, one of the leading sport management and marketing scholars on social media, focuses on the need to study Twitter as a disruptive innovation in sport communication. Making a case that Twitter has disrupted the one-to-many, single-medium framework of sport consumption traditionally offered by television to the many-to-many possibilities of Internet-enabled sport participatory consumption, Pegoraro poses that Twitter's disruptiveness is distinctive in that it was up to the users to define how this platform would be used. Noting varied response to research on Twitter and sport, it is argued that the research process and the building of theory is necessarily not a neat and tidy direct line process. In observing that much research on Twitter and sport to date has ported many of the categories of research agendas and key theories that have driven earlier research on media and sport, the essay concludes that the research process that has been started portends hope for future comprehensive theoretical analysis.

<li>Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010 as a free mobile app. The service rapidly gained popularity, with over 100 million active users as of April 2012 and over 300 million as of December 2014. Instagram is distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play. Support for the app is available for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Android handsets, while third-party Instagram apps are available for BlackBerry 10 and Nokia-Symbian Devices.

The service was acquired by Facebook in April 2012 for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. In 2013, Instagram grew by 23%, while Facebook, as the parent company, only grew by 3%.
