<td><font style= "font-size:20;Line-Height:45px;"><p>Excitement about the role of technology in improving education is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Education is a segment that needs disruptive innovation. To me the hype around things like MOOCs(Massive Open Online Course ) represents a longing by many for "a better educational future" - presumably involving lower costs to students and better career/life fulfillment, not to mention better global citizens needed to solve our global challenges. Let's face it - there is a general sense that the current education system is not up to the challenges of the future. And, it's not clear how we get from "here" to "there"
<br> <b>Examples of some advancements:</b></p>
<ul style = "circle">
<li> <u>Campus Wifi</u><br>
No matter how big or how small your college or university is, everyone from students to the administration are turning to mobile applications and online resources to enhance and improve the overall higher education experience.

Online learning expands educational opportunities to an increasing number of people. Many of these users are highly mobile, and want access on the move.  

This anywhere, anytime scenario causes the demand on your campus wireless LAN infrastructure to grow, both from a performance and security point of view.

This has to be supported through the right campus wifi solution. Coverage used to be the key to your Wi-Fi network, but now density and capacity are becoming the focus.

<li> <u> 3-D Printing</u><br>
When it comes to 3D printing, there are limitless ways in which the technology can be utilized. Businesses, hobbyists, and educational institutions are beginning to fully understand some of the potential benefits that the technology can provide. 3D printing has, and will continue to, provide a means for inventors, innovators, and visionaries to easily fabricate prototypes for designs which they could only depict via 2-dimensional drawings and diagrams in the past. 3D printing will certainly spur on new inventions, simply because inventors now have a way to test out their ideas with tangible models and prototypes.
Where 3D printing has yet to really make a huge impact, but provides an ample amount of opportunity, is within educational institutions. These range from elementary schools to high schools, universities, and maker spaces around the globe. One reason that 3D printing has been quite slow in making its impact in these institutions is simply because of the lack of knowledge of the technology by the decision makers in charge.
Because the technology is so relatively new, the greatest impact may come via the introduction of 3D printing into public and private grade schools. The younger a person is, the easier it usually is to introduce new ideas and methodologies. This is why young children are so quick to learn new languages, when compared to their older adult counterparts. This is what makes elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools the perfect place to begin really introducing a curriculum based around 3D printing.
Just about every subject within a school curriculum could benefit from 3D printing technology.

<li><u> Virtual Reality</u><br>
For our purpose, let's consider VR as a useful tool, and perhaps even a productive enhancement to human interaction, bringing together people from around the world to engage and interact - regardless of social, economic or geographic disparities. In the abstract as well as the applied, modern education is poised to take advantage of this latest tech innovation.

Over the last several years, VR has moved from being the purview of the military and aviation to the mainstream of professional development, as managers, instructors, coaches and therapists have claimed increasing benefit from immersive experiences.

While statistics on VR use in K-­12 schools and colleges have yet to be gathered, the steady growth of the market is reflected in the surge of companies (including zSpace, Alchemy VR and Immersive VR Education) solely dedicated to providing schools with packaged educational curriculum and content, teacher training and technological tools to support VR­-based instruction in the classroom. Myriad articles, studies and conference presentations attest to the great success of 3D immersion and VR technology in hundreds of classrooms in educationally progressive schools and learning labs in the U.S. and Europe.
