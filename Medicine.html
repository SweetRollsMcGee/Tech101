<td><font style= "font-size:20;Line-Height:45px;"><p>Currently prevalent medical technology is decades old. If you look into a medical black bag, the technology there is obsolete - 150 years old stethoscope lying next to 135 years old blood pressure cuff. While the world is growing digital, designing medical technology is still a painfully slow process. In our caution to save lives, we've hobbled our efforts to innovate.However, disruptive technology is already in development for many problems in healthcare. Hundreds of thousands have access to their genetic data, revealing what medical conditions they are susceptible to. Wearable devices let us measure vital signs and health parameters anywhere, not just the doctor's office. The precision of surgical robots lets doctors perform previously impossible procedures. Exoskeletons let paralyzed people walk again, and smart algorithms help analyze radiology images. News every day make us feel as if we live in science fiction.

<li><u> Virtual Reality </u><br>
Once The New York Times gave out Google Cardboards with its newspapers, it was clear virtual reality was going mainstream. But now that Facebook's Oculus Rift just became available for pre-order, virtual reality is going to become a booming industry. With really sophisticated devices on the market, it might have its biggest year ever in 2016. It will be used to let medical students gain realistic experience in examining patients or to let patients see what would happen to them the next day at the hospital for stress release.

<li><u> 3-D Bio-Printing </u><br>
Organovo has been in the focus because of 3D printing biomaterials for years. They announced successfully bioprinted liver tissues in 2014 and they seemed to be 4-6 years away from printing liver parts for transplantation. But first, these bioprinted livers could be finally used in the pharmaceutical industry to replace animal models when analyzing the toxicity of new drugs. If it goes through in 2016, I feel printing actual liver tissue for transplantation could become a commercial service within the next decade.
<li><u> Food Scanners </u><br>
Food scanners like Scio and Tellspec have been in the spotlight since 2014, but as early developer prototypes have already been mailed to their first users in 2015, 2016 could be the year they become generally available. This would enable anyone to find out what's really on their plates, providing clear benefits not just to people looking to gain weight or eat healthier food, but people with dangerous allergies as well.
